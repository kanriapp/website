        <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Behind the Name "Kanri"</h2>
        <p class="mb-4 text-muted-foreground">
            The name "Kanri" is a blend of various inspirations that reflect the purpose and values of the app. It combines traditional productivity principles with modern technology. The "Kan" in Kanri is derived from "Kanban," a productivity method that visualizes workflows using boards, columns, and cards. This reflects Kanri's focus on streamlining personal task management.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-muted-foreground">
            The "ri" in Kanri is a nod to "Tauri," the framework that powers Kanri's offline capabilities. Tauri allows Kanri to function as a desktop app on multiple operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and macOS. Additionally, the term "Kanri" in Japanese translates to "management" or "control," symbolizing the app's mission to empower users to take control of their workflow.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-6 text-muted-foreground">
            Another source of inspiration is the "Hoshin Kanri" planning method, a strategic approach from Japan that emphasizes goal alignment and continuous improvement. In a similar way, Kanri encourages users to set objectives, prioritize tasks, and work toward their goals effectively.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">The Future of Kanri (Roadmap)</h2>
        <p class="mb-4 text-muted-foreground">
            Kanri's development roadmap focuses on enhancing functionality, improving user experience, and expanding its feature set. Our goals for the future include:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-muted-foreground">

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">About the Creator</h2>
        <p class="mb-4 text-muted-foreground">
            Hi, I'm Trobo (also known as Trobonox), a passionate hobbyist developer and student. I created Kanri because, as a fan of Kanban, I couldn't find an offline app that suited my needs for storing confidential data locally. This project began with a request from a community member who saw my previous work on a Kanban web app. From there, I developed the original version, KanbanElectron, and later rewrote the app using Tauri to enhance its capabilities.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-6 text-muted-foreground">
            I'm grateful for the support and interest in this project and look forward to continuing to develop Kanri for all users. If you have any feature requests or want to contribute to the project, feel free to reach out.
        </p>
