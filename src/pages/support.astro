            Kanri is an open-source project primarily developed by one person and a team of open source contributors and other community members. As such, we have limited resources for providing direct support. However, we're committed to helping our users as best we can within these constraints.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Community Support</h2>
        <p class="mb-6 text-muted-foreground">
            Before reaching out directly, we strongly encourage you to join our Discord community. Many of our users are knowledgeable and helpful, and they may be able to assist you with your issue more quickly than our small team can. You can find solutions to common problems, share your experiences, and get help from fellow Kanri users.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Contacting the Team</h2>
        <p class="mb-6 text-muted-foreground">
            If you've tried the community resources and still need assistance, you can contact us via email. Please understand that as an open-source project, we don't have a dedicated support department, and response times may vary.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-6 text-muted-foreground">
            As an open-source project, we welcome contributions from the community. If you've encountered a bug or have an idea for an improvement, consider submitting an issue or pull request on our GitHub repository. This not only helps us improve Kanri but also benefits the entire user community.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Understanding Our Limitations</h2>
        <p class="mb-6 text-muted-foreground">
            We want to emphasize that Kanri is a labor of love, not a commercial product with a dedicated support team. Our ability to provide individual support is limited by our available time and resources. We appreciate your understanding and patience as we work to balance development, improvements, and user support.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Help Us Help You</h2>
        <p class="mb-6 text-muted-foreground">
            When seeking help, whether in the community or directly from us, please provide as much detail as possible about your issue. Include information about your operating system, Kanri version, and steps to reproduce the problem. The more information you provide, the better we can assist you.
        </p>
        
        <p class="mb-6 text-muted-foreground">
            Thank you for your support and for being part of the Kanri community. Together, we can make Kanri even better!
