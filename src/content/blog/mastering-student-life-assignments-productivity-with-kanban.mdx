The COVID-19 pandemic completely disrupted education, particularly because all students now had to navigate a vast and confusing landscape of online learning.
Like many, I experienced the shift from traditional classrooms to a fully remote study environment, which disrupted the structure that schools typically provide. Without classrooms, standard lunch breaks, or face-to-face interactions, the organization of assignments became a daunting task. The combination of assignments sent via email, video conferences, and various e-learning platforms left me feeling overwhelmed and disoriented.

## Finding a Solution
For a while, I was scrambling to find a solution to manage my assignments. My initial approach involved printing out all assignments and marking information on them, but this quickly led to unmanageable stacks of paper cluttering my desk. I realized I needed a digital solution that would integrate with my online learning. It was during this chaotic period that I discovered the power of Kanban boards. Implementing Kanban methodology into my study routine provided the clarity and organization I desperately needed. Suddenly, keeping track of assignments became manageable; whenever I received a notification about an assignment, my first action was to add it to my Kanban board.

## Understanding the Kanban Board
In a Kanban board, tasks are organized into columns, with the "To Do" section being the first stop for new assignments. I would assign each task a clear name and add essential context such as due dates, relevant tags, and descriptions detailing the requirements. For assignments that had multiple steps or exercises, I included a checklist to visualize the workload ahead.
Here's an example how it could look like:

## Daily Routine and Task Management
Each morning, I would sit at my desk and check for any new assignments. If there were no updates, I would turn my attention to my Kanban board, which provided a comprehensive overview of my tasks. To maintain motivation and momentum, I preferred starting with simpler tasks—those with one or two short subtasks that could be completed in about 30 minutes and were due soon. This quick win helped me build confidence for the day.

As I progressed, I would gradually tackle larger assignments with a larger amount of subtasks due in the coming days. My approach was to break these bigger tasks into manageable chunks. For instance, if I had a large project spread over a week with seven subtasks, I aimed to complete the first four in a single day. The remaining three would be integrated into my schedule over the following days, allowing flexibility while ensuring steady progress.

This method not only helped me stay organized but also allowed me to adapt my workflow based on my focus levels. If I found myself losing concentration, I would pivot to another task, ensuring that I remained productive without feeling overwhelmed.
