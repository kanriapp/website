# Import boards from Trello™
Importing boards from Trello™ to Kanri is pretty easy. Just follow this step-by-step guide to copy all boards with just a few clicks.

## What does Kanri import?
Kanri imports the board including all columns and cards, including the description of each card.

## What does Kanri NOT import?
    • Due-dates on cards => work in progress
    • Activities on cards => Planned for future release
    • Attachments on cards => Planned for future release

Please keep in mind that Kanri is in a beta-stadium at the moment and many features are on their way.

## Export your board in JSON-format
Open Trello and go to your board. On the top-right, you see the menu:

When the menu has opened, click on „Print, Export and share“:

Then export the board as a JSON-file:

In some rare cases, the download is not started immediatly, but you see the JSON-file. When this happens to you, just click on „Save“ at the top-left corner to save the file to you computer.
